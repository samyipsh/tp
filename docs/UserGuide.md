NetworkUS is a desktop app for organizing contacts. It features seamless **group management**, allowing for **quick searches of contacts with desired traits** (i.e specialization) and hence **project group formation**. It is catered for **Computer Science Students**. The app is optimized for the **Command Line Interface (CLI)** to allow swift access for keyboard users. The app is also complemented with **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** to display the program.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters with **prefixes** can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter with **prefix** is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Additional parameters for commands that do not take in parameters will be ignored. (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`)<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* INDEXES allows multiple INDEX to be entered with each INDEX being separated with a space.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `tag 1 2 3 cs2030`, it will tag first, second and third persons in the displayed contact list.

## Alias Features

Alias helps you create more customized commands. You can shorten the existing commands, or even completely rename it with other names. Here are example use cases of alias:
* Create `tag -A` as an alias for `tagall` command
* Create `tag -D` as an alias for `untag` command

The following are details of the alias-related commands

### Aliasing commands : `alias`

Creates an alias for existing NetworkUS command.

Format: `alias EXISTING_COMMAND YOUR_ALIAS`

* Creates an alias `YOUR_ALIAS` for command `EXISTING_COMMAND`.
* `YOUR_ALIAS` can contain spaces, but cannot be empty.
* `EXISTING_COMMAND` must be an existing command in NetworkUS (e.g. `list`, `tagall`, `untag`, etc.)
* `EXISTING_COMMAND` and `YOUR_ALIAS` must be separated by a space.
* Aliases that you create will be saved.
* NetworkUS only replace your input with corresponding commands if the alias matches the **prefix word(s)** of your input.
  * A **word** is defined as contiguous characters whose character that comes after (if any) and before (if any) the word is a space.
  * For example: the alias `tag -A` will match the command `tag -A parameter`, but `tag -AD parameter` **will not be matched** even though `tag -A` matches the prefix of words `tag -AD`.
* NetworkUS will check the **longest matching alias** in your input and change it with the corresponding command.

Example:
* `alias tagall tag -A` will create an alias `tag -A` for the `tagall` command, allowing `tag -A` to represent `tagall`.
* `alias tagall tag` will throw an error as `tag` is an existing NetworkUS command. **You cannot create alias as an existing command name**.
* `alias notACommand tag -A` will throw an error as `notACommand` is not an existing NetworkUS command. **You are only able to create an alias for existing commands**.
* `alias tag add n/Your Name` will create alias `add n/Your Name` for the `tag` command. Note that this kind of alias is not recommended. See the **caution** section.

Example of how alias replacement works:
* Suppose that you have created two aliases (in any order):
  * `tag -A` as command `tagall`
  * `tag -A -D` as command `untagall`
* The command `tag -A -D OS` will be replaced as `untagall OS` regardless of the order of you create the aliases because the longest matching alias that matches the prefix word is `tag -A -D`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Use it carefully. You are encouraged to create appropriate aliases. Refrain from creating alias that resembles existing command syntax, such as create alias `add n/Your Name` as any `tag` or `add` or any other commands. **NetworkUS will not handle these cases for you.**
</div>

### Showing saved aliases : `showalias`

Shows all aliases stored in the user preferences in a new window.

Format: `showalias`
Keyboard Shortcut: `F2`

Example:
* `showalias` will show the aliases in a new window.

### Dealiasing commands : `deletealias`

Deletes an existing alias.

Format: `deletealias YOUR_ALIAS`

* Deletes the specified alias.
* `YOUR_ALIAS` must be an existing alias in NetworkUS.

Example:
* `deletealias tag -A` will remove the alias `tag -A`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Storage

### Saving the data

Contact list data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.


### Editing the data file

Contacts data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/networkus.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, NetworkUS will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ContactBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Miscellaneous

### Duplicate detection

**Checked fields**: `Phone`, `Email`, `Github` and `Linkedin`

A person is considered a duplicate in any of the below cases:
* All of that person's **Checked fields** are empty, and there is another contact with the same name and also having all their **Checked fields** empty.
* That person has the same name as another contact, and also at least one identical non-empty **Checked field**.
